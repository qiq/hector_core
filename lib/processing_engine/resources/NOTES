Due to non-compatibility of linking a shared library against loadable module,
we do this for every resource:
- create a shared library for the class (e.g. libTestResource)
- create a loadable module with create() method to create the resource (e.g. TestResource)

Modules using resource should link against the library,
Resources::CreateResource() uses the wrapper.
